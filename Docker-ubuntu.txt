Docker Versions
There are three versions of Docker available, each with its own unique use:

Docker CE is the simple, classic Docker Engine.
Docker EE is Docker CE with certification on some systems and support by Docker Inc.
Docker CS (Commercially Supported) is kind of the old bundle version of Docker EE for versions <= 1.13.Prerequisities:

4) add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu xenial stable" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list  // Adding APt source for installing
5) apt-get update   //Running again so that docker packages are recognised now before installing
6) apt-cache policy docker-ce  //To verify whether we are using correct repo or not.
